# KPDB - Windows kernel-mode PDB parser
Only supports getting symbols, will add types parsing capability on the next release. Check out `DriverEntry.c` for usage example. Will add a better README later. This is a modified and ported-to-pure-c version of [namazso's](https://gist.github.com/namazso/4bfafdb0233f72f5d13bfee825c203f7), so credit to him.
